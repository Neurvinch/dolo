# 🏆 YOUR WINNING GAME PLAN - ONE-PAGE SUMMARY

## **PROJECT: DataFlow Agent**
**Target: Win ALL 5 Awards = $15,000 + Interviews + GSoC Mentorship**

---

## **THE CONCEPT IN 60 SECONDS**

🤖 **DataFlow Agent** is an autonomous multi-agent system that:
1. **Aggregates** data from 5+ different sources (APIs, databases, CSVs, webhooks, third-party services)
2. **Summarizes** each source using AI agents (Kestra + Oumi fine-tuned LLMs)
3. **Synthesizes** insights and **makes autonomous decisions** with confidence scores
4. **Uses Cline CLI** to autonomously generate Kestra workflows
5. **Deploys** beautiful, performant UI on Vercel
6. **Maintains** professional OSS quality with CodeRabbit

## **KEY SUCCESS FACTORS**

### ✅ Most Important (Don't Skip)
1. **Kestra workflow works end-to-end** (5 sources → 5 summaries → 1 decision)
2. **Decision output is valid JSON** (judges verify this)
3. **Vercel is live and fast** (Lighthouse 95+)
4. **GitHub shows steady commits** (not all day 7)
5. **README explains all 5 awards** (scannable sections)

### ✅ Important (Do if time allows)
6. Cline CLI is autonomous (generates valid YAML)
7. Oumi model shows 20%+ improvement
8. Tests are at 100% coverage
9. CodeRabbit is enabled and visible
10. Demo video is professionally done

### ✅ Nice-to-have (Polish if you can)
11. Mobile responsive design
12. Dark mode support
13. Real-time WebSocket updates
14. Model released on HuggingFace
15. Social media posts for raffle

## **RED FLAGS TO AVOID**

❌ **Will KILL your submission:**
- Kestra workflow doesn't execute
- Decision agent output isn't JSON
- Vercel is slow (LCP > 3s)
- GitHub has only 2-3 commits
- Demo video crashes/freezes

❌ **Will HURT significantly:**
- No tests at all
- README is generic/sparse
- CodeRabbit not enabled
- Project doesn't use all 5 technologies
- Claims not verified (say "20%+" not "50%")

✅ **Will HELP significantly:**
- Steady git commits over 7 days
- Demo is smooth + impressive
- Multiple award sections in README
- Real data + results (not mockups)
- Professional presentation
